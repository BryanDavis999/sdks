# lib-manager 

## Fighting the villanous `npm link` command
Module that manages local npm modules and cross linking. This module was built to solve the problem of linking local modules.
In my development, I often segregate independent code into npm modules of their own with a package.json in their respective folders, to enable usage of require statements like: `import {variable} from 'mylocalModule';` instead of: `import {variable} from '../../../common/modules/myLocalModule';`

Running the `local-link` command in your main project will locate all sub-directories with a `package.json` file, run `npm link` at their respective folders, and then `npm link` all your local modules to the parent application after.

## Usage

###Automated postinstall

`
npm install lib-manager --save-dev
`

Best way to use this module is to include the `local-link` command from your app's `node_modules\.bin` folder as part of your postinstall script in your main `package.json`, like so:


    {  
	    "name": "myModule",  
	    "version": "1.0.0",
	    "description": "README",
	    "main": "index.js",
	    "scripts": {
	        "postinstall": "./node_modules/.bin/local-link",
		"test": ""
         }
    }

###Command line utility

`
npm install lib-manager -g
`

You can run the command line utility by invoking `local-link` in your parent app directory.
