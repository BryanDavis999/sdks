### When using an iframe

If you embed dashboards using the iframe method, you can make changes to the UI by heading over to https://dashboard.onvo.ai/dashboards/:dashboard-id/settings. Here you will find multiple options to customise.

### When using the react library

If you are using the react library, you have a few options to customise the interface in the library. You also have endless customisability by changing the styles using css.

```jsx
<DashboardList variant="list|grid"></DashboardList>

<Dashboard editable={false|true}>
    <DashboardGrid />
    <DashboardQuestions />
</Dashboard>
```
