### Installation

1. Run the setup script provided by the Onvo team on your system.

```bash
cd Onvo
./setup
```

2. This will create a `.env.example` file displaying the keys you will have to fill in. Create a `.env` file with the same keys and fill in values with your own providers.

```bash
DASHBOARD_URL="https://dashboard.onvo.ai"
DATA_SERVICE_URI="https://data-service.onvo.ai"

OPENAI_API_KEY="<openai-api-key>"

SMTP_HOST="smtp.google.com"
SMTP_PORT="465"
SMTP_PASSWORD="<smtp-password>"
SMTP_USER="<smtp-username>"

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL="https://api.supabase.com"
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="<supabase-anon-key>"
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET="<super-secret-jwt-token-with-at-least-32-characters-long>"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY="<supabase-service-key>"

### IF YOU NEED GOOGLE SHEETS, UNCOMMENT OUT THE FOLLOWING
# GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="<google-client-id>"
# GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="<google-client-secret>"

### IF YOU NEED ZOHO, UNCOMMENT OUT THE FOLLOWING
# ZOHO_CLIENT_ID="<zoho-client-id>"
# ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET="<zoho-client-secret>"

### IF YOU NEED AIRTABLE, UNCOMMENT OUT THE FOLLOWING

3. Now you can run the platform by running

```
