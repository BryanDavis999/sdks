### Introduction

Onvo AI is a platform that lets you embed beautiful, user friendly dashboards into your products. It's powered by AI so
your users do not have to be technical in order to use it.

This documentation provides an overview of how to use Onvo AI embedded into your products. It encompasses a collection
of endpoints that
allow seamless interaction with Onvo's servers. These endpoints can be utilized for various purposes, and we strive to
make the integration process straightforward.

### Development

For developers using node.js, we recommend leveraging the `@onvo-ai/node` package to consume these endpoints
effectively. This package provides a streamlined approach to interacting with the API.

For developers using react, we recommend leveraging the `@onvo-ai/react` package to visualize the dashboards. You
can also use iframes for building dashboards which is covered in the Quickstart section.
