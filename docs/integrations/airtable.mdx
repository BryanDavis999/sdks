### What can I do with this integration?

You can pull in data from multiple tables/databases as data sources on Onvo to build your dashboards and reports. Any datasource using the MySQL integration will be kept in sync with the underlying data to keep your dashboards live.

You can create beautiful, interactive dashboards using your Airtable data. Just ask for the kind of visualisation you want in natural language to create a widget on the dashboard. You can also ask for data pre-processing before visualisation. We also allow for questions in natural language to your data on Airtable.

Once you are happy with your dashboard, you can integrate them into your products with the SDK.

### How do I create a dashboard using multiple tables?

On Onvo, you can do this by creating 2 separate data sources and make sure you mention the field used to correlate the data in the "fields" tab. This will enable the AI to write the necessary code to join the data without having to write any join queries.

### Config parameters

<ParamField path="baseId" type="string">
  Identifier for the base (e.g., "base123").
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="baseName" type="string">
  Name of the base (e.g., "MyBase").
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tableId" type="string">
  Identifier for the table within the base (e.g., "table456").
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="tableName" type="string">
  Name of the table within the base (e.g., "UserData").
</ParamField>

### Security considerations

It is recommended to only share the bases you want with Onvo to prevent sharing data you did not want to share.
