### What can I do with this integration?

You can pull in data from Firestore collections as data sources on Onvo to build your dashboards and reports. Any data source using the Firestore integration will be kept in sync with the underlying data to keep your dashboards live.

You can create beautiful, interactive dashboards using your Firestore data. Just ask for the kind of visualization you want in natural language to create a widget on the dashboard. You can also ask for data pre-processing before visualization. We also allow for questions in natural language to your data on Firestore.

Once you are happy with your dashboard, you can integrate them into your products with the SDK.

### How do I create a dashboard using Firestore data?

On Onvo, you can do this by specifying the Firestore project details and collection in the data source configuration.
