### What can I do with this integration?

You can import data from different sheets within your Google Sheet document as data sources on Onvo. The integration ensures that any updates in your Google Sheet reflect in real-time on your dashboards.

Build interactive dashboards using your Google Sheets data, effortlessly creating widgets based on your visualization preferences. Ask questions in natural language to explore your data, and perform data pre-processing before visualization. Integrating dashboards into your products with the SDK is also supported.

### How do I create a dashboard using multiple sheets?

On Onvo, achieve this by creating distinct data sources for each sheet and specifying the field used for data correlation in the "fields" tab. This allows the AI to generate the necessary code for joining data without manual query writing.

### Config parameters

<ParamField path="docId" type="string">
  Identifier for the Google Sheet document (e.g., "abc123").
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sheetId" type="number">
  Identifier for the sheet within the document.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="sheetName" type="string">
  Name of the sheet within the document (e.g., "SalesData").
</ParamField>

### Security considerations

Exercise caution and only share Google Sheets that you intend to share with Onvo to prevent unintentional data exposure.
